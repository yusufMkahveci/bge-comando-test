# blender-commando-game
My commando game that I started to create with blender 2.79b in 2021 but could not get out of the pause phase. :)
Check out my last stay;
-There are two commandos and we can choose both and move.
-General usage is simple, select the commando with left click, walk or attack with right click.
-They can shoot at two targets and advance while sitting or lying down.
-While one of the commandos shoots fast, the other shoots slower. We can adjust the shooting frequency (of course before starting the game).
-When you select the commandos, a tag appears on the left, and when you press the button on the bottom left, the commando's bag opens on the right.
-I realized that I didn't customize the bags for each commando. This is probably one of the first things to look at.
